PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how [Your Roblox Game Name Here] (the "Game"), operated by [Your Studio/Developer Name, if applicable, otherwise "The Game Development Team"] ("We," "Us," or "Our"), handles information when you access or use the Game on the Roblox platform. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

Our Game primarily interacts with data provided to us by Roblox. This Policy specifically details how our Game handles the information accessible to us through Roblox. For a comprehensive understanding of Roblox's data practices, please review the official Roblox Privacy Policy.

2. Information We Access and Process Through Roblox
As our Game runs on the Roblox Platform, we do not directly collect sensitive personal information like your real name, email address, physical address, or payment information. This information is handled exclusively by Roblox according to their Privacy Policy.
The information our Game accesses and processes, primarily provided to us by Roblox, includes:
 * Roblox User ID: This is a unique, persistent identifier assigned to your Roblox account by Roblox. We use your User ID as the primary key to:
   * Save and load your individual game progress (e.g., levels, achievements, quest progress).
   * Store your in-game currency balances, virtual item ownership, and inventory.
   * Record your game statistics (e.g., score, playtime, wins/losses).
   * Link your actions to your unique identity within the Game for purposes like leaderboards, friend systems, or in-game reporting.
 * Roblox Username: Your public Roblox username may be displayed within the Game for features such as:
   * Leaderboards.
   * In-game chat (if applicable and subject to Roblox's filtering).
   * Displaying your name above your in-game avatar.
   * Friend lists or party systems.

 * Chat Content (if applicable): If our Game includes an in-game chat system, any messages you send are routed through Roblox's chat filters and systems. While Roblox is responsible for the storage and moderation of these chat logs, our Game may temporarily access or display them to facilitate real-time communication between players. We do not independently store or process these chat logs for purposes beyond immediate gameplay interaction and essential moderation.

   * Facilitate core game mechanics, such as matchmaking, leaderboards, and social interactions within the Game.
   * Display your username to other players as part of the multiplayer experience.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, rent, or trade your Personal Data to third parties. Any sharing of data occurs strictly within the context of the Roblox platform as described below:

If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
