Effective Date: July 17, 2025
Kinetix Studio ("Kinetix," "we," "us," or "our") is pleased to provide you with access to our games on the Roblox platform, including "Hunt the Signal" and any other games developed and published by Kinetix Studio (collectively, the "Games"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of all Kinetix Studio Games. By accessing or using any of our Games, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any additional terms and policies referenced herein or provided by Roblox Corporation, including but not limited to the Roblox Terms of Use, Roblox Community Standards, and Roblox Privacy Policy (collectively, "Roblox Policies"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use any Kinetix Studio Game.
1. Acceptance of Terms
1.1. Binding Agreement: By playing, interacting with, creating an account within (if applicable), or otherwise accessing any of our Games, you confirm that you have read, understood, and unequivocally agree to be bound by these Terms. Your continued use of any Kinetix Studio Game, or any of its features, after the Effective Date or any subsequent revisions, constitutes your ongoing and unequivocal acceptance of these Terms and any future modifications or revisions.
1.2. Eligibility and Age Restrictions: The Games are available to users in accordance with Roblox Corporation's age requirements. If you are a minor (under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, typically 18 years old), you represent and warrant that your parent or legal guardian has thoroughly reviewed and explicitly agreed to these Terms on your behalf and has provided you with explicit permission to access and use the Games. Kinetix Studio reserves the right to request proof of age or parental consent at any time and may suspend or terminate access to the Games if such proof is not provided or is deemed insufficient.
1.3. Supplemental Terms: Certain features, events, or specific Games within the Kinetix Studio portfolio may be subject to additional terms, conditions, or rules ("Supplemental Terms"). Such Supplemental Terms will be presented to you in connection with the relevant feature, event, or Game. By using those features, participating in those events, or playing those specific Games, you agree to be bound by the applicable Supplemental Terms, which are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall prevail for the specific feature, event, or Game they govern.
